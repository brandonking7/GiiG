# GiiG - Angularjs with Ruby on Rails
    Giig is a modern staffing aid for restaurants in the style of Uber. GiiGmakers post jobs. The notice is emailed out to all qualified GiiGseekers. The first GiiGseeker who responds gets the job and both parties are notified.

    The user experience is divided in two parts:

    * GiiGseekers and GiiGmakers. The latter can create locations and post jobs for those locations. They can edit and delete jobs and make payments on those jobs after they are completed.

    * GiiGseekers can add skills so they can have access to more jobs. The can respond to jobs and look at them using google maps.
