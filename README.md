# README


Giig is a modern staffing aid for restaurants in the style of Uber. GiiGmakers post jobs.  The notice is emailed out to all qualified GiiGseekers. The first GiiGseeker who responds gets the job and both parties are notified.

This app uses a variety of apis and technologies.
    Paperclip to grab user photos.
    Googlemaps to help users enter locations.
    Stripe to process payments.
    Ruby mailer, along with gmail mailer and figaro to send emails.

The user experience is divided in two parts.
    GiiGseekers and GiiGmakers. The latter can create locations and post jobs for those locations. They can edit and delete jobs and make payments on those jobs after they are completed.

    GiiGseekers can add skills so they can have access to more jobs. The can respond to jobs and look at them using google maps.
